Programmers should be free to pick their own programming
style, and that style should be fully supported by C++.

*-> Multiparadigm (Procedural, Object Oriented, Functional)*

Allowing a useful feature is more important than preventing
every possible misuse of C++.

No implicit violations of the type system (but allow
explicit violations; that is, those explicitly requested by
the programmer).

Unused features should not negatively impact created
executables (e.g. in lower performance).
